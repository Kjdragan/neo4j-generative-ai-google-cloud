# Neo4j Generative AI Document Processing Pipeline - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The Neo4j Generative AI Document Processing Pipeline is a modern, universal document processing system that leverages Google Cloud Platform's latest AI services to create comprehensive knowledge graphs in Neo4j. This system transforms diverse document types into structured, searchable knowledge graphs using advanced AI capabilities for entity extraction, relationship mapping, and semantic understanding.

The solution addresses the critical need for organizations to automatically extract, structure, and interconnect knowledge from large volumes of unstructured documents. By combining Document AI, Vertex AI Gemini 2.5, and Neo4j's graph database capabilities, the system creates rich, queryable knowledge representations that enable sophisticated analysis and insights.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Universal document processing supporting multiple formats and sources
- Intelligent entity extraction and relationship mapping using state-of-the-art LLMs
- Scalable knowledge graph creation with semantic search capabilities
- Production-ready architecture leveraging modern GCP services
- Extensible design supporting domain-specific customization

## Core Features

### 1. Universal Document Processing Engine
**What it does:** Processes diverse document types including SEC forms, financial reports, legal documents, research papers, news articles, and scanned documents.

**Why it's important:** Organizations deal with documents in multiple formats from various sources. A universal processor eliminates the need for multiple specialized tools and provides consistent processing across document types.

**How it works:** Utilizes GCP Document AI with specialized processors (Form Parser, OCR, Document Splitter) that intelligently route documents based on type detection and apply appropriate extraction strategies.

### 2. Advanced AI-Powered Knowledge Extraction
**What it does:** Leverages Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 for sophisticated entity recognition, relationship extraction, and structured data generation using function calling and multi-shot prompting.

**Why it's important:** Traditional rule-based extraction is brittle and limited. AI-powered extraction provides flexibility, accuracy, and the ability to understand context and nuanced relationships within documents.

**How it works:** Implements function calling with JSON schemas, multi-shot prompting with domain-specific examples, and hierarchical processing that maintains context while extracting entities and relationships at multiple granularity levels.

### 3. Semantic Text Chunking and Context Preservation
**What it does:** Intelligently segments documents into meaningful chunks while preserving semantic coherence and maintaining hierarchical relationships between document sections.

**Why it's important:** Effective chunking is crucial for accurate AI processing and embedding generation. Poor chunking leads to lost context and degraded extraction quality.

**How it works:** Employs adaptive chunking based on document structure, implements intelligent overlap for context preservation, and maintains metadata linking chunks to their source context and hierarchical position.

### 4. Neo4j Knowledge Graph Integration
**What it does:** Creates rich, interconnected knowledge graphs with entity deduplication, relationship inference, and vector search capabilities for semantic querying.

**Why it's important:** Knowledge graphs enable sophisticated querying, relationship discovery, and insights that are impossible with traditional document storage. Vector search adds semantic similarity capabilities.

**How it works:** Implements modern Neo4j features including vector embeddings, temporal indexing, and full-text search. Provides intelligent entity merging, relationship scoring, and hybrid search capabilities combining vector, keyword, and property-based queries.

### 5. Scalable Pipeline Architecture
**What it does:** Provides a modular, configurable processing pipeline supporting batch and real-time processing with comprehensive monitoring and error handling.

**Why it's important:** Production systems require reliability, scalability, and observability. A well-architected pipeline ensures consistent performance and easy maintenance.

**How it works:** Implements event-driven architecture with dependency injection, parallel processing capabilities, comprehensive logging with correlation IDs, and flexible configuration management supporting multiple deployment scenarios.
