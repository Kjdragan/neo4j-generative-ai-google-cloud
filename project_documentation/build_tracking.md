### Objective: Setting up GREEN_PROJECT with Modern Document Processing Pipeline

**Key Activities:**

1. **Project Structure Setup:**
   * Created basic directory structure following best practices with clear separation of concerns
   * Set up `src/document_pipeline/` directory for the core document processing functionality
   * Created `tests/` directory for comprehensive test organization
   * Established `src/utils/` for shared utility functions

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   * Created `.env` file with comprehensive configuration options for:
     * GCP project settings and location
     * Vertex AI configuration with Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview model
     * Neo4j connection details
     * Document AI processor IDs for different document types
   * Ensured all sensitive credentials are properly managed through environment variables

3. **Bootstrap Verification:**
   * Implemented `verify_bootstrap.py` script to validate all required GCP resources
   * Added comprehensive checks for:
     * GCP project access and enabled APIs
     * Storage bucket existence and accessibility
     * Service account permissions
     * Vertex AI connectivity with the Gemini model
     * Neo4j database connection and vector index verification

4. **Package Management:**
   * Created `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
   * Strictly using `uv` for package management as per project standards
   * Included modern versions of all required packages:
     * `google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.38.0`
     * `google-cloud-storage>=2.13.0`
     * `google-cloud-documentai>=2.24.0`
     * `google-cloud-secret-manager>=2.16.4`
     * `google-genai>=0.3.0`
     * `neo4j>=5.14.0`

**Technical Decisions & Lessons:**

1. **Vertex AI Client Initialization:**
   * The correct approach for initializing the Vertex AI client is:
   ```python
   client = genai.Client(
       vertexai=True, 
       project=VERTEX_PROJECT_ID, 
       location=VERTEX_LOCATION
   )
   ```
   * This ensures proper authentication and project context for Vertex AI operations

2. **Document AI Integration Strategy:**
   * Decided to implement a processor factory pattern to select appropriate Document AI processor by document type
   * Will support multiple document sources: local file system, GCS bucket, HTTP/HTTPS URLs, and Base64 encoded data
   * Planning to implement intelligent document type detection for automatic processor selection

3. **Neo4j Connection Approach:**
   * Implementing proper URI scheme validation to handle both secure (`neo4j+s://`) and standard (`neo4j://`) connections
   * Adding DNS resolution check before attempting connection to provide better diagnostics
   * Including vector index verification to ensure embedding search capabilities

**Next Steps:**

1. **Document AI Integration:**
   * Implement `docai_processor.py` module with DocumentAI client initialization
   * Create processor factory pattern for document type-specific processing
   * Build universal document intake supporting multiple sources
   * Implement intelligent document type detection

2. **Testing:**
   * Develop comprehensive test suite for Document AI integration
   * Test with diverse document types to verify extraction quality
   * Verify document source flexibility and processor performance

3. **Documentation:**
   * Continue updating this build tracking document with implementation details and lessons learned
   * Create detailed API documentation for each module
   * Document configuration requirements and troubleshooting steps
