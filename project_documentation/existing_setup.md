# Neo4j Generative AI Google Cloud - Existing Setup

This document details the current bootstrapped environment for the Neo4j Generative AI Google Cloud project, including GCP resources, project structure, and configuration.

## GCP Resources

The following Google Cloud Platform resources have been successfully bootstrapped and verified:

### Project Configuration

- **GCP Project**: Access has been verified with appropriate permissions
- **Project Region**: Defined by environment variables (`GCP_LOCATION`, `VERTEX_LOCATION`, etc.)

The following Google Cloud APIs have been enabled for the project:

- **Vertex AI** (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`): For AI model access and processing
- **Compute Engine** (`compute.googleapis.com`): For compute resources
- **Cloud Storage** (`storage.googleapis.com`): For document storage
- **Document AI** (`documentai.googleapis.com`): For document processing
- **Secret Manager** (`secretmanager.googleapis.com`): For secure credential management
- **Identity and Access Management** (`iam.googleapis.com`): For permission management
- **Cloud Run** (`run.googleapis.com`): For containerized application deployment

### Storage

- **GCS Bucket**: A Cloud Storage bucket named `{PROJECT_ID}-data` has been created and configured
- **Bucket Properties**: Location, storage class, and access controls have been verified

### Authentication & Security

- **Service Account**: `neo4j-genai-sa@{PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Service Account Key**: JSON key file has been generated and verified
- **IAM Permissions**: Appropriate permissions for accessing GCP resources

### AI Services

- **Vertex AI**: Connectivity verified with the Gemini model
- **Gemini Model**: Access to `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` has been confirmed
- **Authentication Methods**: Both API key and service account authentication work

### Database

- **Neo4j Aura**: Connection to Neo4j Aura database established
- **Neo4j Connection Details**: URI, username, and password verified
- **Connection Security**: Using `neo4j+s://` protocol for secure connections
- **Database Access**: Basic query execution verified
- **Vector Indexes**: Not yet created (appears as warning in verification)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
neo4j-generative-ai-google-cloud/
├── assetmanager/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── document_pipeline/
│   │       ├── docai_processor.py
│   │       ├── neo4j_uploader.py
│   │       ├── vertex_ai_processor.py
│   │       └── text_chunking.py
│   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── active test files
│   │   └── archive/
│   │       └── legacy test files
│   ├── verify_bootstrap.py

└── project_documentation/
    ├── DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_ARCHITECTURE.md
    ├── build_tracking.md
    ├── build_plan_checklist.md
    └── existing_setup.md
```

### Key Components

1. **Bootstrap Verification**: `verify_bootstrap.py` script verifies all GCP resources and configurations
2. **Document Pipeline**: Components for document processing pipeline in `src/document_pipeline/`
3. **Tests**: Organized test structure with active tests and archived legacy tests
4. **Documentation**: Project documentation in `project_documentation/` directory

## Environment Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration, stored in a `.env` file in the `assetmanager/` directory:

### Critical Environment Variables

- **GCP Configuration**:
  - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The Google Cloud project ID
  - `GCP_LOCATION`: The region for GCP resources
  - `GCP_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of the storage bucket

- **Vertex AI Configuration**:
  - `VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`: Project ID for Vertex AI (can be same as GCP_PROJECT_ID)
  - `VERTEX_LOCATION`: Region for Vertex AI models
  - `VERTEX_MODEL_REGION`: Region for specific model deployments
  - `LLM_MODEL`: Model name (default: `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`)
  - `LLM_THINKING_BUDGET`: Token budget for model processing
  - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Optional API key for authentication

- **Neo4j Configuration**:
  - `NEO4J_URI`: Connection URI for Neo4j database
  - `NEO4J_USER`: Username for Neo4j authentication
  - `NEO4J_PASSWORD`: Password for Neo4j authentication
  - `NEO4J_DATABASE`: Database name

## Package Management

The project uses `uv` for package management instead of pip:

- **Installation**: `uv add package_name`
- **Running Scripts**: `uv run python script.py`
- **Running Tools**: `uv run tool_name`
- **Upgrading**: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`

## Verification Script

The `verify_bootstrap.py` script performs comprehensive verification of the bootstrap setup:

1. **Environment Verification**: Checks for required environment variables
2. **GCP Project Verification**: Confirms project access
3. **API Verification**: Ensures required APIs are enabled
4. **Storage Bucket Verification**: Checks bucket existence and accessibility
5. **Service Account Verification**: Validates service account configuration
6. **Vertex AI Verification**: Tests connectivity to AI models
7. **Neo4j Verification**: Checks database connectivity

The script produces detailed logs and a JSON report of verification results.

## Current Functionality

### SEC Form Processing

The existing code was originally designed to extract information from SEC Form 13D documents, including:

- Entity identification
- Relationship extraction
- Ownership information
- Filing metadata

While this functionality will be maintained, the project is evolving toward a more universal document processing pipeline.

### Limitations

- Current implementation is specific to SEC forms
- Limited document type support
- Basic Neo4j graph structure
- Limited scalability

## Next Steps

The project is transitioning from this bootstrapped environment to a more comprehensive, universal document processing pipeline as outlined in the `build_plan_checklist.md`. The key focus areas include:

1. Universal document processing capabilities
2. Advanced Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 integration
3. Intelligent text chunking and processing
4. Comprehensive knowledge graph integration
5. Scalable pipeline architecture
6. Cloud-native deployment
