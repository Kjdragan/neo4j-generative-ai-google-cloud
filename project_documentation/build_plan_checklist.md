# Neo4j Generative AI Google Cloud Build Plan Checklist

## Overview

This checklist provides a detailed action plan for building a modern, universal document processing pipeline that leverages the latest GCP services to create comprehensive knowledge graphs in Neo4j. While the existing codebase focused specifically on SEC Form 13D information extraction, our new approach will support multiple document types and use modern AI capabilities for knowledge extraction.

### Bootstrapped GCP Resources

The project has already been bootstrapped with the following GCP resources and services:

1. **GCP Project**: Project access has been verified and established
2. **Enabled APIs**:
   - Vertex AI (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`)
   - Compute Engine (`compute.googleapis.com`)
   - Cloud Storage (`storage.googleapis.com`)
   - Document AI (`documentai.googleapis.com`)
   - Secret Manager (`secretmanager.googleapis.com`)
   - Identity and Access Management (`iam.googleapis.com`)
   - Cloud Run (`run.googleapis.com`)
3. **Storage Bucket**: A Cloud Storage bucket named `{PROJECT_ID}-data` has been created and is accessible
4. **Service Account**: A service account `neo4j-genai-sa@{PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with appropriate key file
5. **Vertex AI Access**: Connectivity to Vertex AI has been verified with the Gemini model
6. **Neo4j Database**: Connection to Neo4j Aura database has been established

This build plan will leverage these existing resources rather than recreating them.

### Key Implementation Principles

1. **Universal Document Processing** - Support various document types beyond just SEC forms
2. **Latest GCP Services** - Leverage Document AI, Vertex AI Gemini 2.5, and other modern GCP services
3. **Comprehensive Knowledge Graphs** - Extract rich, interconnected data to build powerful knowledge graphs
4. **Modern Neo4j Integration** - Utilize Neo4j's latest features including vector search capabilities
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Design for production-grade performance and reliability
6. **Proper Package Management** - Exclusively use `uv` for all package management (never pip)
   - Installing packages: `uv add package_name`
   - Running Python scripts: `uv run python script.py`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading packages: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - NEVER use `pip install` or `@latest` syntax

This plan outlines the steps to build this modern pipeline while maintaining compatibility with existing SEC form processing functionality.
