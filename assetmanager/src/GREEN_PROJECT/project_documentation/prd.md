# Neo4j Generative AI Universal Document Processing Platform - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The Neo4j Generative AI Universal Document Processing Platform is a modern, cloud-native system designed to transform diverse document types into comprehensive knowledge graphs using Google Cloud Platform's latest AI capabilities and Neo4j's graph database technology. While the existing codebase focused specifically on SEC Form 13D information extraction, our new approach will support multiple document types and use modern AI capabilities for knowledge extraction.

This platform addresses the challenge of extracting valuable insights from unstructured documents by using advanced AI to identify entities, relationships, and metadata. The processed information is organized into a rich knowledge graph that enables powerful querying, visualization, and analysis. The solution is designed for organizations that need to make sense of large document collections, such as legal documents, financial reports, research papers, contracts, and technical documentation.

## Core Features

### 1. Universal Document Processing

**What it does:** Ingests and processes multiple document types from various sources (local file system, GCS bucket, URLs, base64 encoded data).

**Why it's important:** Expands beyond the current SEC Form 13D-specific approach to support any document type, making the platform versatile and broadly applicable.

**How it works:** Uses Google Document AI with specialized processors for different document categories, combined with intelligent document type detection to route documents to the appropriate processing pipeline.

### 2. Advanced AI-Powered Information Extraction

**What it does:** Extracts entities, relationships, key facts, and metadata from documents using state-of-the-art AI models.

**Why it's important:** Transforms unstructured document content into structured data with minimal human intervention, enabling downstream analysis and insights.

**How it works:** Leverages Google Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Pro for entity recognition, relationship extraction, and metadata identification, with customized prompting for optimal information extraction.

### 3. Intelligent Text Chunking and Embedding

**What it does:** Breaks down documents into meaningful semantic chunks and generates vector embeddings that capture semantic relationships.

**Why it's important:** Enables more accurate document retrieval, similarity search, and knowledge extraction by preserving context and semantic meaning.

**How it works:** Implements advanced semantic chunking with hierarchical document modeling and generates embeddings using Vertex AI embedding models, with vector storage in Neo4j.

### 4. Comprehensive Knowledge Graph Construction

**What it does:** Creates a rich, interconnected knowledge graph from the extracted information.

**Why it's important:** Enables relationship-based querying, pattern detection, and insights discovery that would be difficult or impossible with traditional databases.

**How it works:** Maps extracted entities and relationships to a flexible Neo4j schema, with support for vector similarity search and complex relationship types.

### 5. Scalable Pipeline Architecture

**What it does:** Processes documents efficiently through a modular, configurable pipeline that can scale with document volume.

**Why it's important:** Ensures the system can handle production workloads and adapt to specific processing requirements.

**How it works:** Implements a Cloud-native containerized architecture using Cloud Run, with asynchronous processing capabilities and robust error handling.
